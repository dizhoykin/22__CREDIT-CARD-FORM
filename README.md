The part #22 of Advent of JS2021

Users should be able to:
When the user finishes (blur) entering a credit card number, change the credit card image to match the type of card they entered. You can add a class of `visa`, `mastercard`, `discover`, or `american` to line 16 in index.html

American Express cards always begin with the number 3- more specifically 34 or 37
Visa cards begin with the number 4.
Mastercards start with the number 5.
Discover Cards begin with the number 6.

When the user enters the CVV number, have the card flip over by adding a class of `flip` on line 16 in index.html
